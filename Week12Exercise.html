Project: Sport teams

Part 1:
Way of creation: XML and XSL languages.
Moment of creation: 2 hours timespan during an excercise. Using technology from the latest updates in 2024.
Way of storage: Local hard drive storage, using formatted XML and XSL files. 
Level of structure: Simple, lacking usage of any framework, utilizing XML tags, classes and IDs.
Purpose of the metadata: The metadata is domain independent, not relying on any cloud storage or any calls
to an API or external data structure. It is system independent, thus runnable on most OS.

Part 2:
Initial structure of the project was the usage of plain XML. The initial properties were simple XML tags which definied
the data. The usage of various attributes inside the tags was what allowed the XML to be reachable and transformed into 
more structured representation via the attached XSL file. Furthermore this allows for filtering and a lot more presentational
capibilities.

Part 3:
Domain: Educational domain. In more detail educational domain regarding sports teams history and details around their
geographical location, facilities, visual representation, amongst others. The metadata should include accurate real life data,
gathered from credible sources. The rules are to structure the data in a certain sort of object item called "team" in XML and 
be able to be modified via XSL. 

Part 4:
The schema of this domain should be for general educational, or in some cases enterntainment purpose. 
By the classification, it should provide enough information to be
published in any website or informational digital media, such as a sports media outlet.
